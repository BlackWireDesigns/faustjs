# WP Engine Atlas

This monorepo contains all of the **public** plugins and packages that we plan on publishing.

## Project Structure

* `packages` - NPM packages
* `plugins` - WordPress Plugins
* `themes` - WordPress Themes

## Developing

As this is a monorepo, you will not be able to check out this repository into `wp-content/themes` or `wp-content/plugins`. 

Instead, you can create symlinks to the themes/plugins in this repository. Best of all, this will also sync your work 
across multiple local sites!
